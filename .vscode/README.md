This code its a scheduler based on what i know how hours are set where i work at, it will run with simular
names from the people that work at my company but they will be numbered with fake ID for simple data added
until I am able to set a cloud for a better privacy.

Phase 1 
Will involve creating a Dummy code where we can visualize where everything will be set this phase will have under it
a date stamp for what im going to do that day or did that day.

8/27/2025 - Today i added a simple sign in with just a button that will direct it to a lost of the department
then created only the bagger html where it will store and show the baggers schedule with only some dummy names 
and a a sidebar with a clickable button that open a small popup.
